## Methodology

### What Counts as Correct?

Each prediction has explicit criteria defined at time of publication:

- **Quantitative predictions:** Must meet stated threshold (e.g., "<50% growth")
- **Binary predictions:** Must occur by stated deadline
- **Qualitative predictions:** Evaluated against stated criteria with evidence

### Immutability

- Predictions are **never modified** after publication
- Original wording preserved exactly as written
- Only outcome and correctness fields updated upon resolution
- All changes logged with timestamps

### Verification

Anyone can verify predictions by:
1. Checking git commit history for original prediction date
2. Comparing against public data sources at resolution date
3. Reviewing linked evidence for outcome determination

### Brier Score Calculation

The Brier score measures probabilistic prediction accuracy. Lower is better (0 = perfect, 1 = worst).

**Formula:**
```
Brier Score = (1/N) × Σ(forecast probability - outcome)²
```

Where:
- **Forecast probability:** Stated confidence (e.g., 60% = 0.60)
- **Outcome:** 1 if correct, 0 if incorrect

**Interpretation:**
| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.00 | Perfect predictions |
| 0.10 | Excellent |
| 0.20 | Good |
| 0.25 | Random guessing (50/50) |
| 0.33 | Poor |
| >0.40 | Very poor |

**Calibration Assessment:**

We also track calibration—whether stated confidence levels match actual accuracy:

| Stated Confidence | Target Accuracy | Meaning |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| 35-45% | 35-45% correct | Well-calibrated |
| 50-60% | 50-60% correct | Well-calibrated |
| 65-75% | 65-75% correct | Well-calibrated |
| >75% | >75% correct | High confidence validated |

Over-confidence = accuracy lower than stated confidence.
Under-confidence = accuracy higher than stated confidence.
