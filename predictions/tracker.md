## Methodology

### What Counts as Correct?

Each prediction has explicit criteria defined at time of publication:

- **Quantitative predictions:** Must meet stated threshold (e.g., "<50% growth")
- **Binary predictions:** Must occur by stated deadline
- **Qualitative predictions:** Evaluated against stated criteria with evidence

### Immutability

- Predictions are **never modified** after publication
- Original wording preserved exactly as written
- Only outcome and correctness fields updated upon resolution
- All changes logged with timestamps

### Verification

Anyone can verify predictions by:
1. Checking git commit history for original prediction date
2. Comparing against public data sources at resolution date
3. Reviewing linked evidence for outcome determination
