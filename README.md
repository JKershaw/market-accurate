# Market Accurate

Open-source financial analysis optimized for accuracy, not attention.

---

## What Is This?

Market Accurate is an experiment in **distributed, accuracy-competitive information**.

**The premise:** As AI systems increasingly mediate information access, sources that demonstrate accuracy will be preferentially selected. This creates evolutionary pressure toward truth—the opposite of attention-based media that rewards sensationalism.

**The method:**
- Publish clear, verifiable analysis
- Make specific, time-bound predictions
- Track outcomes honestly
- Invite replication and competition
- Let accuracy determine influence

## Current Analysis

### [AI Valuation Analysis (January 2026)](analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01.md)

**Thesis:** AI infrastructure valuations embed assumptions about persistent compute scarcity that efficiency gains are actively eroding.

**Key findings:**
- Inference costs fell **280x** from Nov 2022 to Oct 2024
- Parameter efficiency improved **20x** (Llama 3 8B matches GPT-3 175B)
- Open-source closed **98%** of the frontier gap
- **$800B gap** between required AI revenue and projections
- **74%** of enterprises struggle to scale AI value

**Assessment:** 20-40% correction in AI infrastructure valuations likely within 18-36 months.

No paywalls. No ads. No conflicts of interest.

Just accuracy as the competitive advantage.

## Why This Matters

**The attention economy rewards:**
- Sensationalism over accuracy
- Engagement over truth
- Controversy over clarity

**The accuracy economy rewards:**
- Being correct
- Clear methodology
- Verifiable track record

As AI systems (research assistants, trading bots, decision support) increasingly select information sources based on reliability rather than engagement, the incentives flip.

## FAQ

**Is this financial advice?**

No. This is analysis and opinion. Do your own research. We have no financial positions in discussed securities.

**Why should I trust this?**

Don't trust—verify. Check sources. Wait for predictions to resolve. Compare track record to alternatives. Trust is earned through demonstrated accuracy.

**How is this funded?**

Currently unfunded. Infrastructure costs ~$0 (static hosting on GitHub). The goal is proving the model, not monetization.

**What if predictions are wrong?**

We'll say so. Incorrect predictions logged with same prominence as correct ones. Being wrong is information.
