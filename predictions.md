## Prediction Details

### AV-001: NVIDIA Datacenter Growth Deceleration

**Claim:** NVIDIA Q4 FY2026 (reporting Feb 2026) datacenter revenue YoY growth will be below 50%.

**Baseline:** Recent quarters showed 50-66% YoY growth, down from 100%+ in 2024.

**Threshold:** <50% YoY growth in datacenter segment.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### AV-002: Hyperscaler Capex Language Moderation

**Claim:** At least one of Microsoft, Google, Amazon will use moderating language ("optimizing," "efficiency-focused," "disciplined") regarding AI capex in Q1 2026 earnings.

**Threshold:** Explicit language suggesting capex growth rate reduction.

**Note:** Microsoft already showed early signs with "slower pace" language for FY2026.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### AV-003: Open Source GPU Parity

**Claim:** By June 2026, an open-weights model will match or exceed GPT-4 (March 2023 version) on MMLU, HumanEval, and GSM8K while running inference on single consumer GPU (RTX 4090 class).

**Threshold:** Equal or better scores on all three benchmarks.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### SC-001: Memory Price Peak

**Claim:** DRAM contract prices will peak in Q1 or Q2 2026, with Q3 2026 showing quarter-over-quarter price decline.

**Baseline:** Prices rose 30-60% in Q4 2025.

**Threshold:** QoQ decline in average DRAM contract prices in Q3 2026.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### SC-002: Semiconductor Underperformance

**Claim:** The SOX index will underperform the S&P 500 in H1 2026 (January-June).

**Baseline:** SOX returned +41% in 2025 vs S&P 500's ~25%.

**Threshold:** SOX total return < S&P 500 total return for the period.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### AV-004: Enterprise AI Spending Deceleration

**Claim:** Major enterprise survey (Gartner, Forrester, IDC) will report AI spending growth intentions below 25% YoY by Q3 2026.

**Baseline:** 2024-2025 surveys showed 30-50%+ growth intentions.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### HC-001: Quarterly Capex Peak

**Claim:** Combined Big 4 quarterly capex will peak below $150 billion before the end of 2026.

**Rationale:** Current Q3 trajectory (~$113B) with 75% YoY growth would imply ~$198B quarters by Q3 2026—unsustainable.

**Source:** [Hyperscaler Capex Tracker](/analysis/hyperscaler-capex-2026-01/)

---

### HC-002: Capex Guidance Reduction

**Claim:** At least one hyperscaler will reduce full-year capex guidance mid-year in 2026.

---

### AV-005: Market Cap Compression

**Claim:** The combined market cap of NVIDIA + AMD + Arm will be lower on December 31, 2026 than on January 3, 2026.

**Baseline:** Combined market cap as of publication date.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### SC-003: Equipment Vendor Decline

**Claim:** At least one major equipment vendor (ASML, Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA) will report YoY revenue decline in Q3 or Q4 2026.

**Baseline:** All major vendors showed growth through Q3 2025.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### SC-004: Foundry Utilization Divergence

**Claim:** TSMC trailing-edge (<7nm) utilization will fall below 70% by Q4 2026 while leading-edge (3nm and below) remains above 90%.

**Threshold:** Official or credible analyst-reported utilization rates.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### AV-006: Efficiency Narrative Mainstream

**Claim:** By mid-2027, "AI efficiency gains" will be cited in mainstream financial press (WSJ, FT, Bloomberg) as a recognized risk factor for AI infrastructure stocks, with at least 5 major articles.

**Source:** [AI Valuation Analysis](/analysis/ai-valuation-2026-01/)

---

### SC-005: Semiconductor Correction

**Claim:** The SOX index will experience a peak-to-trough decline of at least 20% at some point during 2027.

**Baseline:** Historical correction average is 30-45%.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### SC-006: Automotive Recovery

**Claim:** Automotive semiconductor revenue growth will exceed AI/datacenter semiconductor revenue growth in at least one quarter of 2027.

**Baseline:** Automotive has been in correction for 3 years.

**Source:** [Semiconductor Cycle Analysis](/analysis/semiconductor-cycle-2026-01/)

---

### AV-007: Hyperscaler Capex Reduction

**Claim:** At least one major hyperscaler (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) will reduce absolute AI capex YoY by end of 2027.

**Threshold:** Actual reduction, not just growth rate reduction.
