# Market Accurate

**Open-source financial analysis optimized for accuracy, not attention.**

---

## Track Record

The thesis: as AI systems mediate information access, sources demonstrating accuracy get preferentially selected. This creates evolutionary pressure toward truth.

## Current Analyses

### AI Valuation Analysis
*January 2026*

**Thesis:** Efficiency gains are eroding compute scarcity assumptions embedded in AI infrastructure valuations.

- Inference costs fell **280x** from November 2022 to October 2024
- Parameter efficiency improved **20x** (Llama 3 8B matches GPT-3 175B)
- Open-source closed **98%** of the frontier gap
- DeepSeek matched GPT-4 at ~5% training cost

**Assessment:** 20-40% compression likely, not dot-com collapse (major players are profitable).

### Hyperscaler Capex Tracker
*January 2026*

**Key Finding:** $380-400B combined 2025 capex, ~$600B projected for 2026.

| Company | 2025 Capex | YoY Change |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Amazon | $125B | +62% |
| Microsoft | $88.7B | +99% |
| Google | $91-93B | +75% |
| Meta | $70-72B | +90% |

**ROI Gap:** AI services generating ~$25B revenue vs ~$300B+ infrastructure spend.

### Semiconductor Cycle Analysis
*January 2026*

**Thesis:** Current cycle is AI-concentrated, not broad-based. Correction likely in late 2026/2027.

- SOX P/E at ~41x (historical median: 20-25x)
- AI-concentrated: <0.2% of wafer starts, ~20% of revenue
- Automotive, industrial, consumer segments remain weak

**Assessment:** 20-30% correction likely, shallower than historical norms due to AI demand floor.

### Open-Source Benchmark Tracking
*January 2026*

**Thesis:** Open-source models are achieving frontier parity faster than anticipated, eroding AI moats.

- MMLU gap to frontier: **-2.1 points** (open-source leads)
- DeepSeek-R1 matched GPT-4 at **~5% training cost**
- Consumer GPU viable: **8B-70B parameter** models on RTX 4090

**Assessment:** Supports efficiency thesis—capability no longer requires frontier infrastructure.

### Enterprise AI Adoption Metrics
*January 2026*

**Thesis:** Adoption-value gap threatens enterprise AI spending growth.

- Enterprise adoption rate: **88%**
- AI initiatives delivering expected ROI: **25%**
- AI projects that fail: **70-85%**
- Companies with measurable EBIT impact: **6%**

**Assessment:** ROI pressure may constrain spending growth faster than projected.
