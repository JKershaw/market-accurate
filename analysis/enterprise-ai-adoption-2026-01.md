# Executive Summary

This document aggregates enterprise AI adoption metrics from major industry surveys, revealing a significant gap between AI adoption rates and realized business value. This gap supports the AI Valuation Analysis thesis that ROI concerns may constrain enterprise AI spending growth.

**Central Finding:** While AI adoption is nearly universal (88% of enterprises), measurable business impact remains elusive. Only 6% of companies report significant EBIT improvement from AI, and 70-85% of AI projects fail across multiple studies.

**Key Metrics (January 2026):**

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Enterprises with AI initiatives | 88% | Multiple surveys |
| AI initiatives delivering expected ROI | 25% | BCG |
| Enterprises struggling to scale AI | 74% | BCG |
| AI projects that fail | 70-85% | Multiple studies |
| Companies with measurable EBIT impact | 6% | Industry analysis |

**Assessment:** The adoption-to-value gap represents a structural risk to enterprise AI spending growth. As executives demand ROI evidence, spending growth may moderate faster than hyperscaler capex projections assume.

# The Adoption-Value Gap

## Definition

> The **adoption-value gap** measures the difference between the rate of AI technology adoption and the rate of measurable business value realization from that adoption.

A large gap indicates:
1. Hype cycle dynamics (adoption outpacing practical utility)
2. Implementation challenges (technology works but integration fails)
3. Expectation miscalibration (unrealistic ROI projections)
4. Potential spending contraction as executives demand results

## Current State of the Gap

### Adoption Rates (High)

| Metric | Value | Source | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| Enterprises with AI initiatives | 88% | Multiple surveys | 2025 |
| GenAI adoption (any use) | 72% | McKinsey | 2024 |
| AI in production (at least one use case) | 63% | O'Reilly | 2024 |
| Planning to increase AI investment | 78% | Gartner | 2025 |

### Value Realization (Low)

| Metric | Value | Source | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| AI projects failing | 70-85% | Multiple | 2024-25 |
| Delivering expected ROI | 25% | BCG | 2024 |
| Scaled beyond pilot | <20% | Multiple | 2024 |
| Measurable EBIT improvement | 6% | Analysis | 2024 |
| "Experimental" vs "Production" | 3:1 ratio | O'Reilly | 2024 |

# Connections to Other Analyses

## AI Valuation Analysis

| Prediction | Enterprise Adoption Support |
|------------|----------------------------|
| AV-004 (spending growth <25%) | Survey data shows deceleration trend |
| AV-005 (market cap decline) | ROI pressure reduces demand growth |
| AV-007 (capex reduction) | Enterprise demand constraints upstream |

## Hyperscaler Capex Tracker

| Connection | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Enterprise demand = cloud demand | If enterprise spending slows, cloud AI demand follows |
| ROI pressure → cost optimization | Enterprises will prefer efficient over powerful |
| Failure rates → reduced expansion | Pilots that fail don't become production workloads |

---

# What Would Prove This Analysis Wrong

| Thesis Element | Disconfirming Evidence |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Adoption-value gap persists | Success rates rise above 50% |
| Spending growth decelerates | 2026 actual growth >35% |
| ROI pressure increases | CFO scrutiny decreases |
| Failure rates stay high | Production deployment rates >40% |

# Methodology

## Data Sources

| Source Type | Examples | Update Frequency |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Consulting surveys | McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Bain | Annual/Bi-annual |
| Analyst firms | Gartner, Forrester, IDC | Quarterly |
| Industry reports | O'Reilly, Dataiku, DataRobot | Annual |
| Earnings analysis | Fortune 500 transcripts | Quarterly |
| Academic research | MIT Sloan, Harvard Business Review | Ongoing |

## Aggregation Method

1. Collect surveys with >500 respondents
2. Normalize for sample bias (industry, geography)
3. Weight by recency (newer data weighted higher)
4. Cross-validate findings across multiple sources
5. Flag outliers for investigation

## Limitations

- Self-reported survey data subject to bias
- "AI project" definition varies across surveys
- Success criteria differ between studies
- Response rates may skew toward engaged enterprises
- Spending intentions ≠ actual spending
