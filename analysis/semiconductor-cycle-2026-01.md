# Executive Summary

The semiconductor industry is in an unusual upcycle that began in November 2023—but this cycle differs fundamentally from historical patterns. While past cycles were driven by volume growth (PCs, smartphones, cloud), the current cycle is characterized by **profitability without volume growth**, concentrated in AI-related demand.

**Central Finding:** The semiconductor cycle is likely to correct in late 2026 or 2027, consistent with SEMI's base-case forecast. However, the correction will be shallower than historical norms (20-30% vs 45-70%) because AI-driven demand provides a structural floor absent in previous cycles.

## The Core Tension

Current semiconductor valuations embed two beliefs in tension:

1. **The traditional cycle is broken:** AI demand is structural, not cyclical, justifying elevated multiples indefinitely
2. **Historical patterns persist:** 3-4 year cycles remain the norm; the upturn that began late 2023 peaks in 2026-2027

The evidence suggests both are partially correct: AI provides a higher floor, but the cycle's amplitude has not been eliminated.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current (Jan 2026) | Historical Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| SOX P/E (TTM) | ~41x | 20-25x median |
| SOXX YTD return 2025 | +41% | +21% long-term avg |
| Global semi market | $772B (2025E) | $527B (2023) |
| TSMC market share | 71% | 54% (2020) |
| TSMC 2nm utilization | 100% (Q4 2025) | N/A |
| HBM price change | +20% (2026 contracts) | Typical: cyclical |
| DRAM contract prices | +30-60% (Q4 2025) | Cyclical swings |

## Assessment

- **High confidence:** Current cycle is AI-concentrated, not broad-based; correction more likely than consensus expects
- **Moderate confidence:** 2027 correction of 20-30% in semiconductor equities
- **Lower confidence:** Precise timing; policy risks (China export controls) create uncertainty

**Bottom line:** The "gigacycle" narrative has merit for AI-adjacent semiconductor demand, but non-AI segments (automotive, industrial, consumer) remain weak. A desynchronized correction is more likely than a synchronized boom.

# The Semiconductor Cycle

## Definition

> The semiconductor cycle refers to the periodic boom-bust pattern in the semiconductor industry, historically repeating every 3-4 years, driven by supply-demand imbalances in chips and capital equipment. Cycles typically feature: (1) demand surge → (2) capacity expansion → (3) oversupply → (4) price collapse → (5) capacity rationalization → (6) demand recovery.

## Historical Cycle Characteristics

Based on 34 years of data, the industry has experienced 9 complete cycles:

| Cycle Phase | Typical Duration | Characteristics |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Upturn | 18-24 months | Stocks lead profitability by 1-2 quarters |
| Peak | 2-4 quarters | Maximum valuation multiples, aggressive capex |
| Downturn | 12-18 months | Inventory correction, fab underutilization |
| Trough | 6-12 months | Capex cuts, price stabilization |

### Historical Drawdowns

| Period | Peak-to-Trough | Duration | Trigger |
|--------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Dot-Com (2000-2002) | -70% | 30 months | Telecom bust |
| Financial Crisis (2008-2009) | -60% | 16 months | Credit crisis |
| Trade War (2018-2019) | -30% | 6 quarters | China tensions |
| COVID/Rates (2022) | -45% | 10 months | Rate hikes, inventory |

**Key finding:** Corrections of 30-45% are normal; 60-70% corrections require systemic shocks.

# The Current Cycle: 2023-Present

## Timeline

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Oct 2022 | SOX bottoms (-45% from peak) | Trough of 2022 correction |
| Nov 2023 | Upturn confirmed | Beginning of current cycle |
| Jan 2024 | ChatGPT moment sustained | AI narrative solidifies |
| Q3 2024 | NVIDIA revenue peaks at +112% YoY | Maximum growth rate |
| Jan 2025 | DeepSeek shock | $589B single-day NVIDIA loss |
| Q4 2025 | NVIDIA growth decelerates to 50-66% | Early deceleration signs |
| Jan 2026 | Current state | 26 months into upturn |

## What Makes This Cycle Unusual

### 1. Profitability Without Volume

| Metric | Expectation (Normal Cycle) | Reality (2024-2025) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Wafer volumes | Rising | Flat to slightly up |
| Revenue | Rising with volumes | Rising faster than volumes |
| ASPs | Stable to declining | Rising significantly |
| Fab utilization | Rising | Mixed (TSMC 73%, SMIC 96%) |

**Interpretation:** Value is concentrating in AI chips, which represent <0.2% of wafer starts but ~20% of revenue. This is unprecedented concentration.

### 2. Desynchronized Segments

| Segment | Cycle Phase (Jan 2026) | Notes |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| AI/HPC | Peak/Late upturn | Demand exceeding supply |
| Memory (HBM) | Peak | +20% 2026 contract prices |
| Memory (DDR) | Constrained | Supply diverted to HBM |
| Automotive | Trough/Early recovery | Still correcting since 2022 |
| Industrial | Trough | Weak demand |
| Consumer/PC | Early recovery | Memory constraints limiting |
| Smartphone | Stable | Modest growth |

**Implication:** A synchronized downturn is unlikely. More probable: AI segment softens while other segments recover, creating a "rotation" rather than crash.

### 3. The "Gigacycle" Thesis

Analyst Ben Bajarin (Creative Strategies) argues the current cycle is a "gigacycle"—a multi-year structural shift rather than a typical cycle:

| Gigacycle Thesis | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| AI demand is structural | Hyperscaler capex accelerating | DeepSeek showed efficiency gains |
| Multi-year investment cycle | $600B projected 2026 capex | ROI concerns emerging |
| Trillion-dollar market by 2030 | WSTS projecting $975B in 2026 | Non-AI segments weak |

**Assessment:** The gigacycle thesis is partially correct—AI creates a higher floor—but does not eliminate cyclicality. The amplitude may be reduced, not eliminated.

# Memory Market Deep Dive

## The HBM-DDR Trade-Off

The current memory market exhibits a critical dynamic: HBM demand is cannibalizing DDR capacity.

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| HBM capacity per wafer | 4x lower than DDR (same die size) |
| HBM revenue per wafer | ~10x higher than DDR |
| DDR production decline | DDR4 dropping to 20% of 2025 levels by 2026 |
| Consumer impact | PC prices +4-8% in 2026 |

**Implication:** Memory makers are rationally prioritizing HBM, but this creates artificial scarcity in consumer memory that will eventually correct.

## Memory Price Cycle Position

| Phase | Characteristics | Current State |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Trough | Prices bottom, cuts announced | Passed (2023) |
| Recovery | Prices rise, inventory normalizes | Current position |
| Peak | Prices max, capacity expands | Approaching (H1 2026?) |
| Oversupply | Prices fall, inventory builds | Expected (2027?) |

**Key data point:** Samsung and SK Hynix raising 2026 HBM contract prices 20%—typically a late-cycle signal when pricing power is maximized before capacity catches up.

# Foundry Landscape

## Market Concentration

| Foundry | Q3 2025 Share | Q3 2024 Share | Trend |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| TSMC | 71% | 64.9% | ↑ Gaining |
| Samsung | 7.3% | 9.3% | ↓ Losing |
| SMIC | 5-6% | 5.3% | → Stable |
| Intel Foundry | 2-3% | 1% | ↑ Ramping |

## 2nm Race

| Foundry | 2nm Status | 2026 Capacity Target | Yield |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| TSMC | Volume production | 100,000 wpm | 65-75% |
| Samsung | Early production | 21,000 wpm | 40-50% |
| Intel (18A) | Ramping | N/A | 55-65% |

**Assessment:** TSMC's dominance is increasing, not decreasing. This concentration creates both opportunity (pricing power) and risk (single points of failure).

# Equipment Market (WFE)

## Spending Forecast

| Year | WFE ($B) | YoY Change | Key Drivers |
|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 2024 | $104 | Record | AI buildout |
| 2025E | $116 | +11% | HBM, advanced logic |
| 2026E | $126-135 | +9% | Continued expansion |
| 2027E | $135-156 | +7% | Capacity additions |

## China Risk Factor

| Metric | Value | Risk |
|--------|-------|------|
| China % of global WFE | 36% | Significant |
| 2025 China WFE | $38B | -24% YoY |
| Export control impact | 50% of China WFE at risk | Uncertain |

**Assessment:** China's share of equipment spending is declining due to export controls, but remains material. Further restrictions could impact equipment makers significantly.
