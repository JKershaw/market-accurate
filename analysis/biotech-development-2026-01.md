# Executive Summary

This analysis examines whether AI-driven efficiency gains will reverse "Eroom's Law"—the empirical observation that drug development costs have doubled roughly every 9 years since 1950 (the reverse of Moore's Law). Early data suggests AI may be inflecting this trend, but no AI-discovered drug has yet received FDA approval.

**Central Finding:** AI is demonstrating significant efficiency gains in early-phase drug development (80-90% Phase I success vs. 40-65% historical), but the thesis remains **speculative** until AI-discovered drugs complete regulatory approval. Biotech valuations reflect M&A-driven optimism more than proven AI productivity gains.

**Key Metrics (January 2026):**

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Average drug development cost | $2.6B | Historically rising |
| Average development time | 14.6 years | Historically stable |
| Phase I success (traditional) | 40-65% | Declining |
| Phase I success (AI-discovered) | 80-90% | Significantly higher |
| AI-discovered molecules in trials | 75+ | +60% CAGR |
| FDA approvals from AI drugs | 0 | Pending first approval |
| XBI YTD return | +35.8% | Strong rally |

**Assessment:** High uncertainty. AI efficiency gains are real but unproven at scale. The 2026-2028 patent cliff creates structural M&A demand that may inflate valuations independent of AI productivity.

# Eroom's Law: The Core Problem

## Definition

> **Eroom's Law** (Moore's Law spelled backwards) describes the empirical observation that the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars of R&D spending has halved approximately every 9 years since 1950, despite technological advances.

## The Productivity Crisis

| Metric | Historical Value | Trend |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Cost per approved drug | $2.6 billion | Doubling every ~9 years |
| Development time | 14.6 years | Stable/increasing |
| Clinical trial failure rate | ~90% | Worsening |
| Phase I to approval success | 6.7% (2024) | Declining (was 10% in 2014) |
| Internal rate of return | 4.1% | Below cost of capital |

## Why Costs Keep Rising

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Low-hanging fruit depleted | Easy targets discovered first |
| Regulatory burden | Larger, longer trials required |
| Increasing complexity | Biologics, gene therapy more complex |
| "Better than Beatles" problem | New drugs must beat existing standards |
| Publication bias | Failed trials buried, knowledge lost |

# The AI Efficiency Thesis

## The Promise

AI proponents argue that machine learning can reverse Eroom's Law by:

1. **Better target identification:** Predict successful drug targets before synthesis
2. **Molecular design optimization:** Generate molecules with higher binding affinity
3. **Clinical trial optimization:** Better patient selection, faster enrollment
4. **Failure prediction:** Kill bad candidates earlier, before expensive trials

## Current Evidence

### Phase I Success Rates

| Drug Discovery Method | Phase I Success Rate | Source |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Traditional methods | 40-65% | Historical average |
| AI-discovered molecules | 80-90% | BCG/Nature analysis |
| Improvement factor | ~2x | Significant if sustained |

### Molecules in Clinical Trials

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI-discovered molecules in trials | 75+ |
| CAGR since 2015 | 60%+ |
| Phase I completed successfully | 21/24 (87.5%) |
| Phase II success rate | 40% |

### Projected Impact

| Metric | AI Impact | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Preclinical time savings | Up to 40% | McKinsey |
| Preclinical cost savings | Up to 30% | McKinsey |
| Clinical phase acceleration | 20-50% | ITIF |
| Potential R&D productivity gain | 2x | BCG projection |

# The Validation Gap

## Critical Caveat

> **As of January 2026, no AI-discovered drug has received FDA approval.**

This is the fundamental uncertainty in the AI efficiency thesis. Early-phase success may not translate to late-phase and regulatory success.

### The Pipeline Status

| Phase | AI Molecules | Traditional Success Rate |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| Preclinical | 200+ | N/A |
| Phase I | 50+ | 40-65% |
| Phase II | 20+ | 30-35% |
| Phase III | 5+ | 50-60% |
| Approved | 0 | — |

### When Will We Know?

| Milestone | Expected Timeline |
|-----------|------------------|
| First AI-discovered Phase III completion | 2026-2027 |
| First AI-discovered FDA approval | 2027-2028 (earliest) |
| Statistical validation of efficiency gains | 2028-2030 |

# Comparison to AI Infrastructure Thesis

## Parallels and Differences

| Factor | AI Infrastructure | Biotech/AI Drug Discovery |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Efficiency gains real? | Yes | Yes (Phase I data) |
| Efficiency priced in? | No (30-40x P/E) | Partially (M&A premiums) |
| Validation timeline | Ongoing | 2-3 years |
| Primary risk | Demand destruction | Validation failure |
| What proves thesis wrong | Continued demand | Phase III failures |

## Key Insight

Unlike AI infrastructure (where efficiency threatens the value of compute), in biotech, efficiency **creates** value by:
1. Reducing the $2.6B cost per drug
2. Increasing success rates (fewer wasted trials)
3. Shortening time to market (faster revenue)

If AI efficiency is real, biotech benefits. If AI efficiency fails, biotech returns to Eroom's Law baseline (still has value, just not accelerated growth).
