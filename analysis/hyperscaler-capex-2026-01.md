# Executive Summary

This document tracks capital expenditure by the four major hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Meta) with focus on AI infrastructure spending. It supports predictions AV-002 and AV-007 from the AI Valuation Analysis.

**Key Findings:**

- **Combined 2025 capex:** $380-400 billion (up ~60% YoY)
- **2026 projections:** ~$600 billion (up ~36% YoY)
- **Q3 2025 record:** $106-113 billion in single quarter (75% YoY growth)
- **ROI gap:** AI services generating ~$25B revenue vs ~$300B+ infrastructure spend
- **Capex intensity:** 23.3% of revenue vs 13.9% historical median

**Assessment:** Spending continues to accelerate with no signs of moderation. All four hyperscalers raised 2025 guidance during the year. However, the widening gap between capex and AI revenue creates pressure for eventual rationalization.

# Aggregate Analysis

## Combined Capex Trends

| Year | Combined Big 4 ($B) | YoY Change |
|------|--------------------:|------------|
| 2022 | ~$140 | — |
| 2023 | ~$146 | +4% |
| 2024 | ~$241 | +65% |
| 2025E | ~$380-400 | +60% |
| 2026E | ~$600 | +50% |

## Quarterly Trajectory (2025)

| Quarter | Combined Capex ($B) | YoY Growth |
|---------|--------------------:|------------|
| Q1 2025 | ~$80 | +50% |
| Q2 2025 | ~$95 | +63% |
| Q3 2025 | $106-113 | +75% |

**Observation:** Spending is *accelerating*, not stabilizing. Q3 2025 showed the highest YoY growth rate of the year.

## Capex Intensity (Capex as % of Revenue)

| Period | Capex/Revenue | Historical Median |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2020-2022 avg | ~12% | 13.9% |
| 2024 | ~18% | 13.9% |
| 2025E | ~23% | 13.9% |

**Observation:** Capex intensity is 67% above historical median. This is sustainable only if AI revenue grows commensurately.

# The ROI Gap

## Revenue vs. Investment Mismatch

| Metric | 2025 Value |
|--------|-----------|
| Combined AI infrastructure capex | ~$300B+ |
| AI-related services revenue | ~$25B |
| Implied revenue/capex ratio | ~8% |

**Context:** At current investment levels, hyperscalers need to generate $10-15 of future AI revenue for every $1 of capex to achieve acceptable returns.

## Enterprise AI Adoption Reality

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| AI initiatives delivering expected ROI | 25% | Industry surveys |
| AI initiatives scaled enterprise-wide | <20% | Industry surveys |
| Enterprises struggling to move beyond pilot | 74% | BCG |

**Implication:** Demand-side constraints may limit how quickly hyperscaler AI investments convert to revenue.

# Language Tracking

This section monitors earnings call language for signs of spending moderation—key to prediction AV-002.

## Moderation Indicators to Watch

| Term | Meaning | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| "Optimizing" | Focus on efficiency over growth | Not detected |
| "Disciplined" | ROI-focused spending | Microsoft only |
| "Returns-focused" | Linking spend to revenue | Emerging |
| "Slower pace" | Growth rate reduction | Microsoft FY26 |
| "Rationalizing" | Reducing absolute spend | Not detected |

## Current Assessment by Company

| Company | Language Tone | Moderation Signs |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Amazon | Aggressive | None |
| Microsoft | Measured | **Yes** - "slower pace" for FY26 |
| Google | Aggressive | None |
| Meta | Aggressive | None (despite market concern) |

**For AV-002:** Microsoft's "slower pace" language for FY2026 is the first clear signal. Need to watch Q1 2026 earnings (April-May) for additional companies.

# Predictions Supported

This tracker supports the following predictions from the AI Valuation Analysis:

## AV-002: Hyperscaler Capex Language Moderation
**Claim:** At least one of Microsoft, Google, Amazon will use moderating language regarding AI capex in Q1 2026 earnings.
**Current status:** Microsoft showing early signs ("slower pace"). Watching for April-May 2026 earnings.

## AV-007: Hyperscaler Absolute Capex Reduction
**Claim:** At least one major hyperscaler reduces absolute AI capex YoY by end of 2027.
**Current status:** No indication yet. All four raised 2025 guidance; 2026 projected higher still.

---

# New Predictions

Based on this analysis, the following additional predictions are made:

### Prediction HC-001: Quarterly Capex Peak
**Claim:** Combined Big 4 quarterly capex will peak below $150 billion before the end of 2026.
**Rationale:** Current Q3 trajectory (~$113B) with 75% YoY growth would imply ~$198B quarters by Q3 2026—unsustainable given ROI gap.
**Threshold:** Any quarter in 2026 must be lower than Q4 2025 or Q1 2026.
**Verification date:** December 31, 2026

### Prediction HC-002: Capex Guidance Reduction
**Claim:** At least one hyperscaler will reduce full-year capex guidance mid-year in 2026 (lower guidance than previously stated for that year).
**Rationale:** Pattern of raising guidance may reverse as ROI pressure mounts.
**Threshold:** Explicit reduction in stated guidance range.
**Verification date:** October 31, 2026
